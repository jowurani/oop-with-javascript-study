## What are classes and objects?

We can look at `class` as a blueprint. An object is an instance of a class. If class is a blueprint, an instance of object is the actualization of that blueprint.

Let's take the construction of buildings for an example. Before one literally construct a building, a team of architects have to design the blueprint with all safety measures, state compliances and living spaces. Once a blueprint is completed, the construction team would be able to construct multiple buildings based on the blueprint. Notice that although one blueprint is produced, multiple actualization of that blueprint can be created. 


## Classes & Objects in [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) 6 (ES6)

In our lesson, we will be using ES6 approach.


## Three ways to create an object before ES6

- Object Literal: https://youtu.be/7d9H34ZVRPg
- Factory Function: https://youtu.be/jpegXpQpb3o
- Constructor Function: https://youtu.be/23AOrSN-wmI

You only need to briefly understand how the syntax in pre-ES6 looks like. This lesson aims to help you gain clarity on the ES6 approach. Once you have a good understanding, it is easy to transfer those knowledge to understand these. 

## Test Your Understanding
